    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>
    <p>“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.” – Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016).</p>

    <h1>Autonomous Things</h1>
    <p>Autonomous things, such as robots, drones and autonomous vehicles, go beyond the automation provided by rigid programming models and exploit AI to deliver advanced behaviours that interact more naturally with their surroundings and with people, according to David Cearley, Vice-President and Gartner Fellow.</p>
    <p>Simply put, autonomous things are phenomena powered by the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They work autonomously without human guidance or direct intervention.

    <h1>Immersive Experiences</h1>
    <p>Immersive Technology is any technology that extends reality or creates a new reality by leveraging the 360 space. Because Immersive Technology leverages the 360 space/sphere, users can look in any direction and see content. Some types of Immersive Technology extend reality by overlaying digital images on a user’s environment. Others create a new reality by completely shutting a user out from the rest of the world and immersing them in a digital environment.</p>
    
        Immersive technology is an integration of virtual content with the physical environment in a way that allows the user to engage naturally with the blended reality.  In an immersive experience, the user accepts virtual elements of their environment as part of the whole, potentially becoming less conscious that those elements are not part of physical reality. </p>
